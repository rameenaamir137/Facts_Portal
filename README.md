# Web Application for Pre-Schoolers

This repository contains a simple web application designed for pre-schoolers. The application provides supplementary information to young children in the form of short and interesting facts. The aim is to engage and educate children using animations and pictures.

# Objective

The objective of this project is to create a user-friendly web application that enhances web development skills, particularly in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The application is tailored for pre-schoolers and focuses on delivering engaging content while considering their cognitive capabilities and limited attention span.

# Description

The web application aims to provide pre-schoolers with supplementary information through a visually appealing interface. Key features of the application include:

**Displaying Interesting Facts:** Users can view short and interesting facts presented with animations and pictures to make the content engaging and interactive.
**Navigation:** Users can move forward or backward through the list of facts to explore more information.
**Assessment System:** The application includes a quiz feature with 5 random questions. Users can test their knowledge and receive feedback based on their performance.
**Thresholds and Feedback:** Users will receive animated congratulations if they score the maximum marks in the quiz. If they score above the minimum marks, they will receive a feel-good message.
**User Experience Considerations:** The web application is designed to cater to limited network connectivity, multiple screen usage (desktop or mobile), and the limited attention span of pre-schoolers. It avoids heavy network transfers, uses appropriate image sizes, and employs a child-friendly design.
